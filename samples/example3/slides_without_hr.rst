Some code now
-------------

Let me give you this snippet:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def foo():
        "just a test"
        print bar

Then this one, a more ReSTful way (haha, nerd joke spotted) using the ``sourcecode`` directive:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def bar():
        """pretty cool"""
        print baz


Then this other one with the ``code-block`` directive:

.. code-block:: python

    def batman():
        "foobar"
        return robin
