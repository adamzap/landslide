# Why the Lea Verou's CSSS presentation with Landslide

In order to make a presentation application that could replace conventional applications 
such as MS PowerPoint or Impress OO I looked for presentations that can be viewable by a browser.

I found this presentation (and also other available) based on HTML5/CSS3.
This presentation is quite simple to use for someone who knows a little coding to HTML.
However, for a novice or a person reluctant to programming, I looked for a better 
solution to compose the presentation slides.

After various tests and research, I happily test the landslide application.
This is actually the application that I needed to complete my project.

The rest is a bit of coding and adaptation to present a simple, easy to use 
application and to think about some improvements.
